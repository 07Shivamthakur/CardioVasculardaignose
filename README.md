## Introduction

This expert system utilizes both backward chaining and forward chaining algorithms to identify and treat different cardiovascular diseases. It presents users with a set of symptoms and guides them through the identification and treatment of potential diseases.

The repository contains the following components:

- `BackwardChaining.py`: Implementation of the backward chaining algorithm to identify the disease based on symptoms.
- `ForwardChaining.py`: Implementation of the forward chaining algorithm to provide treatment recommendations for identified diseases.
- `main.py`: Main application logic that interacts with the BackwardChaining and ForwardChaining modules.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/07Shivamthakur/Cardiovascular-expert-system-python.git
